  	<td align="left" class="simple-text"><p>1: It is the responsibility of the sender to ensure that the Mac is suitably packaged for shipment and will not be damaged in transit. Money4Macs.co.uk and our courier are not responsible for damage caused in transit. The box that your computer originally came in is adequate for shipping. If you do not have the original packaging and are unsure of how to package your item, please feel free to call us on 0117 939 6254 and we will be happy to advise. The Mac MUST be boxed in a minimum of a double walled cardboard box. Small-bubble bubblewrap is ok for laptops as long as you use enough but for desktop computers you MUST use large-bubble bubblewrap as small-bubble bubblewrap is inadequate for the job. If you cannot source any packaging materials we can offer a service to supply them, however we charge £20+VAT for this. Please note that if you would like to purchase packaging supplies from us payment will be required up front and is a separate transaction. It is not taken out of the final payment for your goods. If you believe that the packaging supplied by us is inadequate then please contact us immediately on 0117 939 6254. Any damaged, irreparable goods will either be returned to the sender (see point 2 for charges) or we will pay the faulty rate**. Don&rsquo;t allow the courier to pack the item as they are not qualified to  do so.
  	  <br>
	  <br>
  	  2: Our engineers will test your computer and any faults or problems not specified at the time of agreeing to our terms and conditions will affect the quote significantly. In the event this happens, you will be contacted immediately by us. If a machine is tested and is found to be faulty when expected to be working then we pay our book price for faulty macs. This is calculated on age, model and CPU (G4, G5, Intel etc.). If you are not satisfied, you can have the mac returned to you at your cost (See point 6 below). We can provide reports of our testing results upon request. We charge £75+VAT to return faulty or damaged macs should you not accept the faulty book price. This covers the cost of collection, testing and re-delivery.  A new corrected quote will need to be calculated for machines not specified correctly at the quoting process. Should you not accept the corrected quote then the same £75+VAT charge will apply to return the Mac. This covers the cost of collection, testing and re-delivery.
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  	  6: All accepted quotes are agreements. Once the goods have been collected, you are agreeing to receive payment of the agreed amount in return for your goods. You may not request for goods to be returned after this point. In exceptional circumstances Money4Macs.co.uk can return goods for a fee of £75+VAT.
  <br>
  <br>
  	  7:  Money4Macs.co.uk reserves the right to cancel an agreement at any time, for any reason, with immediate effect. In the unlikely circumstances of this occurring after we have taken delivery of your goods, we will return the goods to you at our own cost.
  <br>

  	  8:  Money4Macs.co.uk uses an industry recognised program to remove the data from your hard drive. Although this is one of the most secure ways of removing data Money4Macs.co.uk will not be held responsible in the event of mistreatment of data or any other circumstances involving personal information, personal data etc. We advise you back up any important files before sending to us. Once wiped by our software there will be no chance of any files left on the computer when sent to us could be recovered. Once the computer has left you, you should assume that all data stored within has been lost. By accepting our terms and conditions you understand that you are fully responsible for any data and for the clearing of said data on any hard drive in any machine sold to Money4Macs.co.uk. If you feel you have confidential data on your drive we recommend for peace of mind you data wipe the drive. We don&rsquo;t need the OS to test the hardware as we use external drives and software.
  <br>
  <br>
  	  8: Payment will be initiated within 2 to 3 working days of us receiving the goods from you (usually 2 days). This does not mean you will necessarily receive payment within 3 working days. Most transfers nowadays are very fast but bank transfers can still take up to 5 working days depending on which bank you bank with. For this reason we are only able to offer an estimated date of receipt of payment.
  <br>
  <br>
  	  9: Payment options:
  <br>
  <br>
  	  &nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;Bank Transfer - to process this we will need your bank account number and sort code, if you are not happy about supplying this information either by telephone or in writing then you will need to choose payment by PayPal.<br>
  	<br> 
	  &nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;PayPal - To process this we will need your PayPal user name (this is the email address you use to log in to PayPal). If you do not have a PayPal account then you can either create one for free at <a href="http://www.paypal.com/">www.paypal.com</a> or you can opt to be paid by Bank Transfer
  <br>
  <br>
  	  10: In the unlikely event of damage to our premises through fire, water damage, storms, terrorism, robbery, theft, explosion, act of god or other catastrophic disaster, in which stock/goods are damaged, we are obliged to pay our fully quoted amount as agreed to at time of collection. This amount is payable as per our terms. A full police/insurance report can be forwarded in the extremely unlikely event of any of these circumstances.
  <br>
  <br>
        11: Our courier insures any consignment by default to a maximum £1000. If you require extra insurance on your consignment please call us on 0117 939 6254. We deal with additional insurance for consignments on a case by case basis.
 <br>
 <br>
        12: Any missed collections due to the computer not being available for collection, either due to the premises being closed or the parcel not being ready for collection will be charged at £10+VAT per failed attempt. We are charged this by our courier for any collection attempts that are unsuccessful through no fault of their own. Any failed collection attempts due to a problem with our courier will not be charged.
 <br>
 <br>
        13: Our courier cannot guarantee the time at which they will collect the parcel; Interlink Express can only guarantee the date of collection. If collection from your home address will be a problem we can arrange a collection from a friend/relative's house or a work address at no extra cost. Collections in the London area can be anytime from 9am to 6:30pm. For more information we can provide contact details of your local Interlink Express depot upon request.
 <br>
 <br>
        14: You must be 18 years or older in order to sell your mac through Money4Macs.co.uk as it binds a contract legally when you accept the quote. You must also be the legal owner of the goods. We take a VERY dim view on stolen goods and check ALL purchases against the online database of stolen Apple computers once the goods are with us. Any goods discovered to be stolen or any other fraudulent or criminal activity will be reported to the relevant authorities.
 <br>
 <br>
        15. At present Money4Macs.co.uk only accepts orders from within the British Isles. Highland areas and outlying islands are included but are subject to an additional charge imposed by our courier Interlink Express. The courier company may sometimes change depending on your location as Interlink subcontract other couriers to collect in more remote areas.
 <br>
 <br>
        **Standard faulty rate is dependent on the processor type. For G4 based computers it is £40, for G5 based computers it is £50 and for Intel based computers the faulty rate is £60.
